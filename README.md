# Weather Dashboard

A simple weather dashboard built with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
It allows users to search for any city and view current weather information along with a 5-day forecast.  

## Features
- Search weather by city name  
- Display temperature, humidity, wind speed, and condition  
- 5-day forecast with daily summary  
- Save favorite cities (stored in local storage)  
- Dark/Light mode toggle with preference persistence  
- Loading and error handling  
- Responsive design

## Tech Stack
- Next.js (React framework)  
- Tailwind CSS for styling  
- OpenWeatherMap API for weather data

## Clarification

I made this project with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS** to manage them in a modern way. In the end, it still runs on standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
